  The Dutch have a word "gezellig" which has connotations of "cozy" and "family atmosphere" and "friendly" (although it is quite a difficult work to pin down exactly - see <a href="http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/09/23/gezelligheid-gezellig/">here</a> for more details).  This word is a great way to sum up the Dutch Clojure Days conference we held in Amsterdam a month ago.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="http://dutch.clojuredays.nl/">Dutch Clojure Days</a> conference was a free conference run on a single day in Amsterdam.  It is the direct successor to the October Amsterdam Clojure event which has run over the past three years.  It was organised by the <a href="http://amsclj.nl/">Amsterdam Clojurians</a> and the <a href="http://www.ehrdclj.org/">Rotterdam/The Hague Clojure Meetup</a> and attended by about 35 people.  This is a somewhat late summary of what was a great day.  (Also, full disclosure, I am one of the organisers).
</p>

<p>
  The day started off with <a href="https://github.com/michalmarczyk">Micha≈Ç Marczyk</a> presenting to us his experience of extending the Clojure/ClojureScript persistent data structures while building <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.rrb-vector">core.rrb-vector</a> and <a href="https://github.com/michalmarczyk/avl.clj">avl.clj</a>.  It was great to hear explanations of algorithms from someone with such a deep knowledge of the area and it was refreshing to hear that the expansion of fundamental parts of Clojure could be accomplished relatively easily.
</p>

<p>
  Next up we had a pair of lightening talks from <a href="https://twitter.com/vijaykiran">Vijay Kiran</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wvdlaan">Walter van der Laan</a>.  These both covered the <a href="http://pedestal.io/">Pedestal</a> web application tool set.  Vijay provided an overview while Walter showed us a basic application.  It was interesting to see Clojure's data-oriented thinking spreading to web applications, it seems a really innovative and powerful strategy.

<p>
  After a short coffee break <a href="http://twitter.com/kotarak">Meikel Brandmeyer</a> gave us a fantastic explanation of <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a>, explaining the whole thing without using a single powerpoint slide!  Instead he demonstrated it using humans to represent threads in the system passing actual objects to each other.  He started with a simple system with two threads and a single channel and gradually built up to multiple threads with multiple channels.  He also showed how the process works in a single threaded environment using hats.  This had to be seen to be believed!
</p>

<p>
  After a sponsor-provided lunch we had an unconference session.  We ran this session after the success of last year's.  The way this worked was to split the two hour slot into two one hour sessions and to split the venue into three areas.  We then created a grid to represent this and had attendees suggest topics for time/place slots using post-it notes.  We had a variety of sessions, including talking about what would be required for a functional operating system, a new web framework an attendee had produced and talking about Pedestal.
</p>

<p>
  For a change of pace we followed this up with a talk about using Clojure from a business point of view by <a href="https://twitter.com/vanelsas">Alexander van Elsas</a> of <a href="http://www.adgoji.com/">Adgogi</a>.  This was an interesting talk on how the company has used Clojure, why they moved to Clojure and the improvements in the development process that have been brought about through this.  It was particularly interesting to hear the reasons to switch to Clojure from a business point of view - something you too rarely see.
</p>

<p>
  The last talk of the day was from <a href="http://twitter.com/mishok13">Andrii Mishkovskyi</a> on the <a href="http://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> the distributed realtime computation system.  Specifically, it was talking about what were good use-cases for using Storm and what were bad ones.  Andrii talked from a position of having implemented a Storm cluster and the joy and pain involved in that and then the realisation that some of the things they wanted from Storm might be better provided by simpler, custom, code.  It was a good talk to round the day off with - a day that included data structures, asynchronous threading theory and business based talks ending with a from-the-trenches view of some much talked about technology.
</p>

<p>
  Finally the sponsors provided us with some beer at a local bar.  Here we were able to talk in more depth with the presenters and chat with people from many different backgrounds and perspectives in a very Amsterdam bar.  I started off this review declaring the day as "gezellig" or cozy, and it was.  The whole day felt like a day with friends and comrades, whether listening to a presentation, participating in the unconference, having lunch or drinking in the bar.  I'd like to thank the (other) organisers and the sponsors (<a href="http://backbase.com">backbase</a>, <a href="http://adgoji.com">adgogi</a>, <a href="http://announce.ly">announcely</a>, <a href="http://screen6.io">screen6</a>) for enabling the day to be such an interesting and "gezellig" day.  I can't wait for next year's edition.
